🚀 Power BI Sales Dashboard Project 🚀

As part of the analytics team, I developed a fully automated, interactive Power BI dashboard to provide business stakeholders with actionable insights into the sales performance of restaurants 🍽️ across cities 🏙️ in India.

🌟Key Work Areas:
ETL Automation: Streamlined the data pipeline with Power Query Editor to clean, transform, and structure data for accuracy and relevance.

DAX Calculations: Built calculated measures for key metrics, including Average Order Value (AOV), Discount %, Customer Rating, and Average Delivery Time to track performance and customer satisfaction.

Interactive Dashboard Design: Created user-friendly visuals (combo charts, trend lines, bar charts, and pie charts) to highlight:
 - Revenue and Orders Trends over time
 - City & Restaurant Performance metrics
 - Delivery Efficiency insights
Dynamic Slicers: Added slicers for city and restaurant names, allowing leadership to filter data in real-time for customized insights.

📊Business Impact:
1. Revenue Trends and Growth Patterns
2. Operational Efficiency: Insights on delivery times
3. Customer Satisfaction through rating analysis

This Power BI project showcases the value of data-driven decision-making with ETL automation, DAX modeling, and dynamic dashboards for strategic insights.
